            <span><br>Some of you may ask yourselves...what is FCA? FCA stands for Fellowship of Christian Athletes. This is a club from the orginial orginization. Here is the <a href="https://www.fca.org" target="_blank">website</a>. FCA is 
            a place where young Christians have the opprutunity to gather in a public school and live out their faith. We may play a game or we'll do a lesson. We have events where we all just hangout after school
         like for example we sometimes go to an indoor trampoline park or go see a movie. Over all this is a club where students have an opprutunity to share their testimony to those that need it or just need a refresh from the week of school.
         We meet @ 7am on Wednesdays. Hope we will see you there. If you want to see the clubs leaders, go ahead and click over to the <strong>leaders</strong> tab.
